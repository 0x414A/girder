### How to use the icons

To see the whole list of available icons, open the **icon-list.html** file in your browser. It
will display all available icons with their class name next to them. To include an icon in your
HTML, just add that class name to an **<i>** tag, e.g.:

    <i class="icon-mail"></i>

Or, in jade:

    i.icon-mail

To change the color or size of your icon, set the font-size or color style properties on the
parent element of the icon.
